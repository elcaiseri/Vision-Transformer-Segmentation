## About
The Vision Transformer Segmentation project implements ViT in PyTorch for the HuBMAP Kaggle competition. The goal is to identify glomeruli in human kidney tissue images using the power of transformers in computer vision tasks.

## Datasets and Weights
- Training Dataset: [hubmap-pytorch-vit-segmentation-train-datasets](https://example-dataset-link)
- Inference Dataset: [hubmap-pytorch-vit-segmentation-inference-datasets](https://example-inference-link)

## Evaluation
This competition is evaluated on the mean Dice coefficient, which compares the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth.

## LeadBoard-Score
- Private Score: 0.9354
- Public Score: 0.9064

## Usage
To use this Vision Transformer Segmentation project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/elcaiseri/Vision-Transformer-Segmentation.git`
2. Explore the implementation and code for ViT in PyTorch.
